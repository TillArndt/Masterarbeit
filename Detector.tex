\chapter{The LHC and the CMS detector}

This chapter describes the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the second part the CMS detector and its most important subsystems are explained.

\section{ The Large Hadron Collider}

The LHC \cite{LHCTDR} is located in a tunnel beneath the French Swiss border region near Geneva. The tunnel lies about \SI{100}{\meter} below the ground and has a circumference of \SI{26.7}{ \kilo \meter}. At the LHC, 1232 superconducting magnets are used to produce a magnetic field with a maximal strength of \SI{8.3}{\tesla}.\\
Protons as well as heavy ions can be acellerated by the LHC. For the proton-proton collision, two counter rotating beams of protons are accelerated and then brought to collision at four interaction points. According to design, the proton collisions are provided with a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = \SI{14 }{\tera \electronvolt}$ and an instantaneous peak luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{inst} = \SI{d34}{\per \centi \meter \tothe{2} \per \second}$. Neither the design energy nor the design luminosity have been reached until now. \\
The accelerator complex is shown in Figure \ref{fig_det_accel}. In order to reach high energies, protons are preaccelerated by the Linear Accelerator 2 (Linac2), the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB), the Proton Synchrotron (PS) and finally by the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). Through this preaccerleration, the protons reach an energy of $\SI{450}{\giga \electronvolt}$ when injected into the LHC. \\

  \label{fig_det_accel}
\end{figure}

Four major detectors are located around the LHC ring at the four interaction points. \\
Two of the four, CMS \cite{cmsTDR1} and ATLAS \cite{AtlasTDR}, are multipurpose detectors. They are designed to cover a large range of physics topics and particles. Additionally, each experiment is able to corroborate or refute the results of the other, allowing for independent validation of these results.\\
ALICE \cite{AliceTDR} on the other hand is a detector specialized on researching heavy ion physics. One of its central research topics is the investigation of quark-gluon plasma, which is predicted to be created in high energy heavy ion collisions. ALICE is able to record and reconstruct events with a very high particle multiplicity (about 50,000 particles per event). \\
LHCb \cite{LHCbTDR}, the fourth detector, measures particles only on one side of the interaction point. Concentrating on precision measurements of the SM, for example in the CP-violating sector, the detector is build for b-physics. The main interest in b-physics lies in the forward region, due to the relativley long lifetime of B mesons. This leads to the assymetric structure of the detector.\\
In addition, two minor experiments LHCf \cite{LHCfTDR} and TOTEM \cite{TOTEMTDR} are situated in the forward regions of ATLAS and CMS respectively. The TOTEM experiment focuses on the proton substructure. LHCf is concerned with development of hadronic showers and the associated phenomenological methods. \\
In 2012 the beam energy was set to \SI{4}{\tera \electronvolt} ($\sqrt{s} = \SI{8}{\tera \electronvolt}$). CMS recorded an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{int} = \SI{21.79}{\per \femto \barn}$ of the \SI{23.30}{\per \femto \barn} provided by the LHC (see Figure \ref{fig_det_lumi}). \\
Following the end of the current shutdown of the LHC, the center of mass energy will be increased for proton-proton collisions to $\sqrt{s} = \SI{13}{\tera \electronvolt}$ in 2015.\\

\section{The Compact Muon Solenoid}
The CMS detector is shaped cylindrically, as shown in Figure \ref{fig_det_cms_draw}. It weighs \SI{14000}{\tonne}, has a length of \SI{30}{\meter} and a height (diameter) of \SI{15}{\meter}. As a multipurpose detector, it consists of multiple subsystems which are described in the following  section, starting with the innermost part. \\
The CMS coordinate system is defined as follows: The origin lies at the interaction point. The z-axis points parallel to the beam pipe in westward direction. The x-axis is directed south, towards the center of the LHC ring. The y-axis points upwards, vertically completing the right handed system. Polar ($r$, $\phi$, $z$) and spherical coordinates ($r$, $\phi$, $\theta$) are defined using this system. The pseudo rapidity $\eta = - \ln{(\tan{(\theta / 2)})}$ is often used instead of $\theta$ in order to be independent of the Lorentz boost.\\

\end{figure}

\subsection{The Tracking System}

The purpose of the CMS tracking system is the identification and reconstruction of tracks and vertices. Therefore, fine granularity, a high magnetic field and a good spatial resolution are important to be able to distinguish between multiple tracks. \\
To this end, the tracker is divided into two subsystems: The silicone pixel detector, which is the closest sub detector to the interaction point, and the silicone strip detector. \\

\subsubsection{The Pixel Tracker}

The pixel tracker is again  sub-divided into two parts: The barrel pixel and the forward pixel tracker, as shown in Figure \ref{fig_det_cms_pixel}. The barrel part has a length of \SI{53}{\centi \meter} and the pixels have a size of $100 \times \SI{150}{\micro \meter \squared}$. Three layers are positioned parallel to the beam axis at the radii of \SI{4.4}{\centi \meter}, \SI{7.3}{\centi \meter} and \SI{10.2}{\centi \meter} resulting in an occupancy of about \SI{d-4}{} per bunch crossing in 2011 \cite{Veszpremi:2014hpa}.\\
The forward tracker consists of four disks that are placed at $|z| = \SI{34.5}{\centi \meter}$ and $|z|=\SI{46.5}{\centi \meter}$. They have an inner radius of \SI{6}{\centi \meter} and an outer radius of \SI{15}{\centi \meter} \cite{cmsTDR1}. \\

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth] {Bilder/CMS_Tracker}
      
  \caption{The CMS pixel tracker system. \cite{cmsTDR1}}
  \label{fig_det_cms_pixel}
\end{figure}

Together the two parts have 66 million channels. The spatial resolution is given in Equation \ref{eq_det_pix_res} \cite{cmsTDR1}.

\begin{equation}
r-\phi \; \mathrm{plane}: \; \SI{10}{\micro \meter} \hspace{1cm} z\;\mathrm{Direction}: \; \SI{20}{\micro \meter}
\label{eq_det_pix_res}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{The Silicon Strip Tracker}

The outer part of the tracking system, the silicon strip tracker consists of multiple parts, as shown in Figure \ref{fig_det_cms_strip}.\\
The entire tracker operates at a temperature of \SI{-20}{ \celsius} to withstand the high radiation dose it is subjected to. \\


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth] {Bilder/CMS_SiliconTracker}
      
  \caption{A sketch of the CMS tracker system. \cite{CMSTrackRes}}
  \label{fig_det_cms_strip}
\end{figure}

The overall track reconstruction efficiency depends on the energy and the momentum of a particle. Charged hadrons with an energy $E > \SI{100}{\giga \electronvolt}$ can be reconstructed with 95\% efficiency, which drops to 85\% for an energy of $E = \SI{1}{ \giga \electronvolt}$. \\
The momentum of the particle is measured by the curvature of its track. Consequently, the momentum resolution of a track strongly depends on the spatial resolution, which is shown in Equation \ref{eq_det_strip_res} \cite{cmsTDR1}:  \\ 

\begin{equation}
r-\phi \; \mathrm{plane}: \; 23-53 \SI{}{\micro \meter} \hspace{1cm} z\;\mathrm{Direction}: \; 230-530 \SI{}{\micro \meter}.
\label{eq_det_strip_res}
\end{equation}

\newpage
The momentum resolution of the whole tracking system is given in Equation \ref{eq_det_strip_res_pt1}. As shown in Equation \ref{eq_det_strip_res_pt2} it decreases with $\eta$  \cite{Karimäki:368412,Adam:934067}:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta \pt}{\pt} \approx 0.005 + 0.015 \cdot \pt [\SI{}{\giga \electronvolt}] \hspace{0.5cm} (|\eta|<1.6)
\label{eq_det_strip_res_pt1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta \pt}{\pt} \approx 0.005 + 0.06 \cdot \pt [\SI{}{\giga \electronvolt}] \hspace{0.5cm} (|\eta|=2.5).
\label{eq_det_strip_res_pt2}
\end{equation}

These high resolutions in the tracker are one of the defining properties of the CMS detector. They are reached due to the fine granularity and the high magnetic field (see Section \ref{sec_det_mag}). \\

\subsection{The Calorimeters}

The purpose of the calorimeters is to measure the energy of the particles produced in the aftermath of the proton-proton collisions. Consequently, it is desirable to stop most particles besides muons and neutrinos in the calorimeter. This is achieved by using a high density material.\\
The different interaction lengths for electromagnetic and strong interactions lead to two different calorimeter concepts: The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) and the Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL) (as shown on Figure \ref{fig_det_cms_calo}). The ECAL measures the energy of light particles mainly interacting electromagnetically, like electrons and photons. The HCAL measures particles bound by the strong force.\\

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth] {Bilder/CMS_Calosys}
      
  \caption{Profile of the calorimeters and the tracking system. \cite{CMStdrEcal}}
  \label{fig_det_cms_calo}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsubsection{The Electromagnetic Calorimeter}

In the electromagnetic calorimeter (see Figure \ref{fig_det_cms_ecal}) particles are stopped in the main body, which consists of 61,200 lead tungstate (PBWO$_4$) crystals. These crystals are each \SI{230}{\milli \meter } long and placed $5 \times 5$ in so called superclusters. Their length corresponds to 25.8 radiation lengths. The front of the crystal has a surface area of $22 \times \SI{22}{\milli \meter \squared}$ or $0.0174$ in $\Delta \eta$ and $\Delta \phi$.\\
Silicon avalanche photo diodes measure the emitted scintillation light in the barrel region. In the endcap, vacuum photo diodes are used. In both regions the diodes are directly attached to the back of the scintillation crystals.\\

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth] {Bilder/CMS_Ecal}
      
  \caption{Profile of the electromagnetic calorimeter \cite{cmsTDR1}.}
  \label{fig_det_cms_ecal}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig_det_cms_ecal}, there is a an additional preshower module in front of the ECAL in the endcaps. It identifies neutral pions and improves the spatial resolution using silicone strips as active material and lead as absorber. Consequently, 95 \% of photons shower before the first strip of active material \cite{cmsTDR1}. \\
The overall resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter was measured by testbeams. The result is shown in Equation \ref{eq_det_cms_ecal} \cite{cmsTDR1}:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta E}{E} = \frac{\SI{2.8}{\percent}}{\sqrt{E\; [\SI{}{\giga \electronvolt}]}} \oplus \frac{\SI{12}{\percent}}{E\; [\SI{}{\giga \electronvolt}]} \oplus \SI{0.3}{\percent}.
\label{eq_det_cms_ecal}
\end{equation}

The fiducial region for high energetic photons and electrons of the ECAL covers the $\eta$ range of $|\eta| < 1.4$ in the barrel and $1.556 < |\eta|<2.4$ in the endcaps. This is due to the requirement that the shower has to be completely enclosed within the calorimeter.\\ 

\subsubsection{The Hadronic Calorimeter}

Mesons and baryons are the measured in the HCAL \cite{cmstdrHCAL}. Additionally, the HCAL is vital for the estimation of missing transverse energy. Therefore, the HCAL covers a wide region  ($|\eta| < 5 $). It is comprised of multiple parts as shown in Figure \ref{fig_det_cms_hcal}. While the hadron barrel (HB) calorimeter covers the region $|\eta| < 1.4$, the two hadron endcap calorimeters (HE) cover the region up to $|\eta| = 3$. The hadron forward (HF) calorimeter is located \SI{11.2}{\meter} along the beam axis covering the eta region $3 < |\eta|< 5$. The hadron outer (HO) calorimeter does not provide additional coverage, but is rather used to further contain the hadronic showers as a tail catcher. \\

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth] {Bilder/CMS_HCAL}
      
  \caption{Sketch of the hadronic calorimeter \cite{CMS_Jinst}.}
  \label{fig_det_cms_hcal}
\end{figure}

The HB and the HE are sampling calorimeters using brass as absorber material, interleaving it with plastic scintillator for the active detection. The scintillation light is propagated to the central detector region with wavelength shifting fibers to be read out by hybrid photo diodes. \\
The HB employs 2304 towers with a granularity of $\Delta \eta \times \Delta \phi = 0.087\; \times \; 0.087$ and a sampling length of 7.2 interaction lengths (including the ECAL). In the two HE wheels, the granularity of the 18 modules is similar to the ECAL.\\
\newpage
The HF uses a Cerenkov light based approach with quartz fibers as active material embedded into a copper absorber. This is required due to the high rates and the high radiation in this region of the detector. The HF is mainly used for the measurement of missing transverse energy and luminosity. \\
The energy resolution of the combination of the two calorimeters has been measured with a test beam of pions and is shown in Equation \ref{eq_det_cms_hcal} \cite{HCAL_Perf}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta E}{E} = \frac{\SI{0.7}{}}{\sqrt{E\; [\SI{}{\giga \electronvolt}]}} \oplus \frac{\SI{1}{}}{E\; [\SI{}{\giga \electronvolt}]} \oplus \SI{8}{\percent}.
\label{eq_det_cms_hcal}
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Solenoid}
\label{sec_det_mag}

The solenoid encloses the calorimeters with an inner diameter of \SI{5.9}{\meter}, an outer diameter of \SI{6.3}{\meter} and a length of \SI{12.9}{\meter}.\\
The superconducting magnet is cooled by liquid helium and provides a magnetic field of $B = \SI{3.8}{\tesla}$ inside its coil. Outside its iron return yoke the field strength is $B = \SI{2}{\tesla}$. \\
This magnetic field bents the trajectories of charged particles allowing for the measurement of particle momenta up to the \SI{}{\tera \electronvolt} scale. The charge itself can also be identified from the direction of the curvature. 

\subsection{The Muon System}

The muon system is embedded into the return yoke of the solenoid and covers the range of $|\eta|<2.4$ \cite{CMS_Muon}. As shown in Figure \ref{fig_det_cms_muon}, three types of gaseous detectors are used. Drift tubes (DT) and resistive plate chambers (RPC) are built into the barrel region. In the endcaps, cathode strip chambers (CSC) and RPC are deployed. \\

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.75\textwidth] {Bilder/CMS_Muonsys}
      
  \caption{Profile of the CMS muon system in the r-z plane \cite{cmsTDR1}.}
  \label{fig_det_cms_muon}
\end{figure}

The design ensures a high coverage and allows to measure the momentum of the muon in all three spatial directions. The resolution in $\phi$ is better than \SI{100}{\micro \meter} in position and better than \SI{1}{\milli \radian} in direction.\\
The resolution in \pt when combining information from the muon system and the tracker is shown in Equation \ref{eq_det_cms_muon} \cite{CMS_Muonperf}. The main source of uncertainty on the \pt measurement is the multi scattering of muons in the iron of the return yoke.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta \pt}{\pt} = 0.045 \cdot \sqrt{\pt\; [\SI{}{\giga \electronvolt}]}
\label{eq_det_cms_muon}
\end{equation}

The muon system is one of the most accentuated parts of CMS and is partly responsible for the good reconstruction of muons. Due to this good reconstruction, muons give a very clear signature and are often used to trigger interesting processes. \\

\subsection{Trigger and Data Acquisition}

The structure of the data readout and online trigger system in CMS is shown in Figure \ref{fig_det_cms_tridas}. Since the full event rate of \SI{40}{\mega \hertz} cannot be written to permanent storage, the event rate has to be reduced. By implementing two trigger tiers, it is reduced to a manageable rate of \SI{100}{\hertz}. \\
The signal from the respective detectors is digitized and sent to the first online trigger (Level 1 Trigger). To handle the data rate, the signals are also buffered on the front end electronics. As of 2012, the Level 1 Trigger only uses information from the ECAL, the HCAL and the muon system. The tracking system will be integrated into the Level 1 Trigger in the future \cite{CMS_Upgrade_2011}. The subsystem information is used to reconstruct first object candidates, like electrons or jets. Based on these candidates, a set of selections known as trigger paths are applied. When one of these selections is passed, an event is written to the buffer for the next trigger step. \\
The resulting data rate lies at \SI{100}{\kilo \hertz}. It is passed to the second offline trigger tier called High Level Trigger (HLT). The HLT uses the complete data available from the detector to reconstruct object candidates more precisely than the Level 1 Trigger. The results of the reconstruction algorithms come close to the offline reconstruction, which is performed later. \\
The rate of events passing the HLT is approximately \SI{100}{\hertz}. The events are permanently stored on the CMS computing grid \cite{CMS_HLT,CMS_Tridas_2}.
