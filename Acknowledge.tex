My thanks first of all to Prof. Dr. Achim Stahl for enabling me to write my masters thesis at the physics institute IIIB.

I owe a great debt to Dr. Heiko Geenen for his help and his council.

I would like to thank Heiner Tholen for his introduction into the \ttgamma analysis and the answering of a lot of technical questions.

I am especially grateful to Yusuf Erdogan and Felix H\"ohle for the wonderfull atmosphere in our office and their tireless help.

I would of course also like to thank all my colleagues at the institute in Aachen and at Cern for the great work environment I experienced in the last year.

Thanks for proofreading goes to Yusuf Erdogan, Felix H\"ohle, Heiko Geenen, Steffen Lindemann and Sophie Arndt.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my friends and family for their continous and invaluable support.
